# Autonomous QA Agent

This project is an intelligent, autonomous QA agent capable of constructing a "testing brain" from project documentation. It leverages RAG (Retrieval-Augmented Generation) to ingest support documents and generate comprehensive test cases, which are then converted into executable Selenium scripts for automated testing.
